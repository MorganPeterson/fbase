# F _all your_ Base _s_

Unix core utilities written in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/), converted to [Lua](https://lua.org/) and run in a VM in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

This is a hobby project to learn Fennel and Zig by making unix core utilities then run them in Zig. It is very alpha and may never move beyond that point.

## Requirements

[Lua](https://lua.org/) >= 5.3\
[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) >= 3.5\
[Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) >= 0.8\
[Zig](https://ziglang.org) > 0.7.1
